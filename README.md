# Covid-19-Data-Analyzer

I created a simple data-analyzing tool that analyzes the standard "COVID19_line_list_data" dataset prepared by John Hopkins University.
This tool performs data-analysis on certain claims by the media such as "older people die more frequently than younger people", 
"men are more easily affected by covid-19 than women", etc.
It also contains various plots like histograms, pie-charts, bar-graphs, scatter plots, etc. which shows various information
like "Covid-19 Cases per County", "Covid-19 Cases by Age", "Covid-19 Cases across Europe", etc.

# Technologies Used :

* R
* R-Studio
